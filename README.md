# 📁 File Handling Project in Python

This project showcases basic file handling operations using Python. It allows users to create, write, read, append, and delete data in a text file through a simple menu-driven program.

## 💡 Features

- Create and write to a new file
- Append data to an existing file
- Read and display file contents
- Delete a file
- Simple user interface using console inputs

## 🧾 How It Works

The program provides a menu with options to:
1. Write to a file
2. Append to a file
3. Read a file
4. Delete a file
5. Exit

Each operation is handled by built-in Python file methods such as:
- `open()`
- `read()`, `write()`, `append()`
- `os.remove()` (for deleting a file)
